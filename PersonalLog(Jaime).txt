It has been a difficult project, mainly because of the overlay on our web app to show the mexican map, it caused lot of
trouble, we have been working independently most of the midterm but yesterday, 26th octuber, we stayed at SotoÂ´s house
to work on the project, in one afternoon we made a lot of progress mainly because we were researching and coding together,
when someone had a mistake or someone was tired of watching tutorials on youtube the other ones could detect the mistake,
give fresh ideas and take turns to work.
